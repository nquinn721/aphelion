The game engine your are purchasing is in very early prelimary stages. It is largely an early work in progress. The code and code structure
reflects this early stage and so many things are incomplete or not done in an optimal way. In order to make this into
a fully functioning game engine many things will need to be rewritten, restructured or reanalyzed. That being said it does
serve as a good foundation for building an HTML5 MMO utilizing modern HTML5 web technologies and other modern networking
technologies such as Node.js.

At the time of purchase the engine functions as a basic demo and proof of concept with features as described in the README and as shown in the
live demo @ http://aphelion.rakuhana.org.

I have made an effort to document the code as to make it easier for any other developers hoping to continue development but I make no guarantee
with respect to the functioning of the game engine other than the features that are described in the README.

I will offer future support for basic inquires about the functioning of the game engine or different aspects about it within reason
should you require it but I am in no way obligated to offer further support.

You agree to purchase this code source as is without any gurantee.

The agreed upon price is $325.
